int main()
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}

// a C program whatever its size, consists of functions and variables
// "main" is special, its the point at which a program begins executing
// every program must have a main somewhere

// printf() never supplies a newline on its own, yu can use several calls to build up a single output line

// printf ("hello, "); 
// printf ("world" ); 
// printf("\n"); }

// escape sequences; can use \t for tab, \b for backspace, \" for double quote and \\ for a backslash itself
